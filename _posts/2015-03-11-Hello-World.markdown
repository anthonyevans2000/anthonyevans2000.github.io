First Post!

Finally have the internet after moving into my new place!
I've made a website and hosted it on my own [raspberry pi][raspi] server. Currently it's only hosted within my local network, but I'll get a domain and such soon so I can access and post from the outside world.
I plan to screen in and make notes, code, write blogs and generally hack around with my posts! (Probably more for my own reference than anyone elses, but if I come across a good way to do something I'll post it up!)

I used the steps from [this blog][octopress] to help me generate this site. It's written using the [jekyll][jekyll] 'markdown' language, rather than the octopress jekyll variant suggested by the blog (As the octopress main site suggested that the software was becoming unsupported). I needed to do battle with nginx in order to get the serving to work but it ended in understanding, so that's fine by me!

I'm pleased with the level of convenience that went into setting up the pi- I'm powering it off of usb ports on the back of my router and have simply plugged the ethernet of the pi in directly for networking. It forms a neat little loop which is aesthetically pleasing to me for some reason.

Regardless, posts ahoy!
